ABOUT THE DEMOS DIRECTORY
==================================================

What is in the demos directory? 
------------------------------- 
The "demos" directory is a repository of pre-built example designs that 
may be useful for you to evaluate or run.    

Currently there are 2 subdirectories in the "demos" directory.
1. cycloneIII_3c120_dev_golden_top 
   This is a set of quartus pin files for the Cyclone III 3C120 Development
   Board.  It is a useful starting point to ensure you get the pinouts of 
   your design correct.
2. cycloneIII_3c120_dev_my_first_fpga
   This is "the answer" to the My First FPGA tutorial found in the 
   documents\tutorials\hardware_tutorials directory.
